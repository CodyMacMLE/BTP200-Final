| Learnings: What new concepts or skills did you acquire during this project?							       |
| How did your understanding of C evolve into C++, especially in terms of object orientation?                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This project helped me understand oop hierarchy, along with using virtual functions to call the appropriate
 member function based on its derived object type. 

 Another concept I enjoyed / learned is the ease of creating a menu once as an object, and just needed to 
 create an object of that type. It saves a lot of time and code redundancy.

 It would have been nice to work a little more with templates, however, it is late into the semester and the
 concept is new. On top of that, I believe you mentioned that it is something we look more into in our next 
 programming course.

 One of the challenges of this application was remembering what each member function does across each module.
 Since it was a project that persisted over the past few weeks I needed to go back to each module understand 
 what member function I needed to call. Thankfully, you hinted earlier in the semester that documenting each
 member/member function with /// <summary>... is important. Since I made sure I documented each member function
 before I created it, I knew exactly what each one did. If I didn't I am sure I would have had a lot more
 difficulty. 

 The only other difficulty I would say I mainly had was clearing the input buffer. In C, after every input
 we were told to insert while(getchar() != '\n); which would call getchar() and clear the character until 
 '\n' was found thus flushing everything. C++ input buffer seems a bit more complicated to understand. Going
 over that a bit more or earlier would have been nice.
